This folder contains the python modeling code and dataset related to LSPUF 64 bit challenge and 1 million samples

We use following conventions for LSPUF.

k: Total number of APUFs.

m = Number of output bits.

x = Each output bit is generated by XORing 'x' XORs.

s = circular shifting parameter.

For our experiments, we have used following parameters

k = x + 1

m = x

s = 1

Folder name Convention:

LSPUF_6_5 : LSPUF with k = 6 and x= 5
