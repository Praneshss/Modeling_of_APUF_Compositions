This folder contains the python modeling code and dataset related to LSPUF



We use following conventions for LSPUF.

k: Total number of APUFs.
m = Number of output bits.
x = Each output bit is generated by XORing 'x' XORs.
s = circular shifting parameter.

For our experiments, we have used following parameters
k = x + 1
m = x
s = 1

Folder name Convention:
LSPUF_4_3 : LSPUF with k = 4 and x= 3
LSPUF_5_4: LSPUF with k = 5 and x= 4
